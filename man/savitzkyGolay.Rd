\usage{
savitzkyGolay(X, m, p, w, delta.wav)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a numeric matrix or vector to process (optionally a data frame that
can be coerced to a numerical matrix).}

\item{m}{an integer indcating the differentiation order.}

\item{p}{an integer indicating the polynomial order.}

\item{w}{an integer indicating the window size (must be odd).}

\item{delta.wav}{(optional) sampling interval.}
}

Savitzky-Golay smoothing and derivative of a data matrix or vector.
}
\details{
The Savitzky-Golay algorithm fits a local polynomial regression on the signal.
It requires evenly spaced data points. Mathematically, it operates simply as
a weighted sum over a given window:

\mjdeqn{ x_j\ast = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{h=-k}^{k}{c_hx_{j+h}}}{ x_j ast = 1/N \sum_{h=-k}^{k} c_hx_{j+h}}

where \mjeqn{x_j\ast}{x_j ast} is the new value, \mjeqn{N}{N} is a
normalizing coefficient, \mjeqn{k}{k} is the gap size on each side of
\mjeqn{j}{j} and \mjeqn{c_h}{c_h} are pre-computed coefficients, that depends
on the chosen polynomial order and degree.

The sampling interval specified with the \code{delta.wav} argument is used for
scaling and get numerically correct derivatives.

The convolution function is written in C++/Rcpp for faster computations.
