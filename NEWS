## New features

* The `kenStone` function now includes a new feature that allows to initialize the
calibration sample search with a user-defined subset of observations (which are 
to be included in the final calibration subset). Thanks to Thorsten Behrens and
Philipp Baumann for suggesting this feature. 

* The gap-segment derivatives (gapDer) function now allows for high order 
derivatives. In previous versions the function only allowed up to derivatives of 
4th order, in this version the the function accepts as derivative order 
any integer larger than 1. 

## Improvements and fixes
* `binning() `a bug in the creation of the binning groups has been fixed. This bug 
is in fact inherited from a problem in the `findInterval()` function. The breaks 
(given in the vec arument) might get corrupted when they contain many decimal 
places. These breaks (in vec) are used to define the final bins. The problem in 
the binning function was that when a frequency 
variable (e.g. wavelength) was exactly on the left of the bin
range the variable was assigned to the next bin. In some cases this lead to 
small discrepancies in the in the computation of the mean of the bins. 

* `spliceCorrection()` now accepts one or two values as input for the splice
argument. Previously it only accepted a vector of length two. For example, now it 
corrrects for splice steps of spectra that originates from spectrometers 
with two detectors (i.e. it corrects for the potential abrupt transition 
betwteen the two detectors). 

* An extra sanity check has been added to the `read_nircal()` function. The 
function evaluaes whether it is indeed a file properly produced by the BUCHI 
nircal software. 

* There was a bug in the filter for the 3rd order derivative in gap segment 
derivative (`gapDer`) function. One of the factors in the filter had a wrong 
negative sign. 

* There was a bug in the `read_nircal` function. It emerged only in some files and 
prevented the function from reading the Description field properly 

## Changes
* In the `msc()` function the argument `reference_spc` has been renamed to 
`ref_spectrum` to emphasize that its input must be is a vector and not a 
matrix of spectra.
