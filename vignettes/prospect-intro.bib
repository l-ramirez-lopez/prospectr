	url = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169743911002413},
	doi = {10.1016/j.chemolab.2011.11.013},
	abstract = {The effect of using representative calibration sets with fewer samples was explored and discussed. The data set consisted of near-infrared reflectance ({NIR)} spectra of grass samples. The grass samples were taken from different years covering a wide range of species and cultivars. Partial least squares regression ({PLSR)}, a chemometric method, has been applied on {NIR} spectroscopy data for the determination of the nitrogen (N) concentration in these grass samples. The sample selection method based on {NIR} spectral data proposed by Puchwein and the {CADEX} (computer aided design of experiments) algorithm were used and compared. Both Puchwein and {CADEX} methods provide a calibration set equally distributed in space, and both methods require a minimum prior of knowledge. The samples were also selected randomly using complete random, cultivar random (year fixed), year random (cultivar fixed) and interaction (cultivar\&\#xa0;×\&\#xa0;year fixed) random procedures to see the influence of different factors on sample selection. Puchwein's method performed best with lowest {RMSEP} followed by {CADEX}, interaction random, year random, cultivar random and complete random. Out of 118 samples of the complete calibration set, 19 samples were selected as minimal number of representative samples. {RMSEP} values obtained for subsets selected using Puchwein, {CADEX} and using full calibration set were 0.099\% N, 0.109\% N and 0.092\% N respectively. The result indicated that the selection of representative calibration samples can effectively enhance the cost-effectiveness of {NIR} spectral analysis by reducing the number of analyzed samples in the calibration set by more than 80\%, which substantially reduces the effort of laboratory analyses with no significant loss in prediction accuracy.},
